Test methods NEVER EVER HAVE if's, loops etc.


Should always be 10 lines or smaller.


=================
Naming
=================

For every project there should be separate project for testing e.g. TestNinja -> TestNinja.UnitTests
For every class there should be test class e.g. Reservation -> ReservationTests (plural)

Naming convention is as follows: [MethodName]_[TestingScenario]_[ExpectedBehaviour]


Number of tests for method should be number of execution (return) paths. For example:
        public int Add(int a, int b)
        { 
            return a + b;
        }
Has only one execution path (one return, no if/else, switch etc.) so we need only one test.
